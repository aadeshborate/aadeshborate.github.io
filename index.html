								<h2>Smart and Efficient Techniques for Automatic Guided Vehicle</h2>
								
								<h4><p style="text-align:center">  
		                 			Today the Automatic Guided Vehicle plays an important role in the design of new factories and warehouses. In an automated 
							    	process, AGVs are programmed to communicate with other robots to ensure the product is moved smoothly through the 
								    warehouse, whether it is being stored for future use or sent directly to shipping areas. AGV is one kind of transportation that
									follows the given respective paths and route.
								
								</p></h4>
								<h4><p style="text-align:center">
								Our designed AGV uses the camera for following the line. It has the feature of voltage detection, running time estimation,
								 battery low voltage indication and it is IOT enabled device can be used for storing the data of nodes traversed into the database,
								 the QR code is placed at each node which is scanned using camera and data in QR code is extracted to know which task is to be performed.
								we have used raspberry pi 4 for image processing and Arduino Mega 2560 Microcontroller for locomotion.

								After finalizing the project idea We have started the thinking about the chassis, After lot of discussion we have finalized the Tri-wheel Omni chassis for locomotion of AGV. We have used Autodesk® Fusion 360™ for 3D modelling of Tri-wheel omni chassis and after completion of PCB design, I have developed the 3D model of PCB and Whole bot.
								the wiring diagram is also done using fusion 360.

									<b>Mechatronics and IOT kit Developement</b>
								</h2>
								<h4><p style="text-align:center">  
										When I was in the Third Year we have a mechatronics subject in the syllabus, as the subject was new in the syllabus our department is not having kits
									 	to perform experiments. At that time I had participated in ROBOCON Competition for that I had learned about PCB designing. Since I was a beginner 
									 	I wanted to explore more complex designs but not having the funds for manufacturing  PCB and buy the required components. because of that, I had 
									  	proposed the idea of developing the kit for mechatronics and IOT subjects to the college principal stating the issue. The idea is approved by the 
									  	Principal and I got the funding of 8000 Rs. 
								</p></h4>
								<h4><p style="text-align:center">  
									I had designed the PCB and manufactured it from the Lion Circuits company situated in Bangalore where I had done my first campus Ambassador Internship. Later we had purchased the components for the PCB some online and Some from Electronics Market in Pune.
									After purchasing the components I have done the assembly of the circuit and testing. 
									With the help of this kit, we had performed more than 30 experiments in different subjects of different streams such as Automobile, Mechanical, Instrumentation & Control and E&TC.

								For the competition we have a team of 40 members responsible for developement of two robots one is Manual another is Automatic as defined in theme.
								For manual robot we had selected four wheel mechanum chassis. While the condition for Automatic robot is that it must be quadrupeled (i.e. it must have four legs). 
								so we have designed it accordingly. The Manual robot is operated wirelessly by the operator, for manual robot I had designed the 2 layer PCB. The PCB consists of motor drivers,
								Arduino mega 2560 microcontrollers, sensors signal processing circuits etc. The automatic robot circuit is hand soldered on zero PCB due to costing and time limitations, which 
								consists Arduino mega 2560 microcontrollers, Inertial measurement unit, display, signal processing circuitry, motor drivers etc.

								In eYRC 2019 after round 1 selection we got the Biped Patrol theme. In the theme we have to design the LQR controller for the robot, the robot is two wheel self balanced bot.
								The two wheel self balance bot has to pass the obstacles in his path. I have designed the 3D model of robot in fusion 360. we had used 3D printing for the manufacturing of the robot, 
								and to reduce the weight. The robot consists of Electromagnetic gripper for picking the object from one place to another, so we have designed the symmetric structure on both sides of bot for gripper.
								For design of complete Robot we have used the following technologies : 3D modelling, 3D Printing, PCB Designing, PCB etching, soldering etc.
								The PCB consists of GY87 Inert measurement unit, Arduino mega 2560 Microcontroller, indication Led, Buzzer, Motor driver, zigbee module for wireless communication.
								for operating the balance bot wirelessly we had used zigbee communication.
